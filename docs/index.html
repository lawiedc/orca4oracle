<h1>Orca for Oracle</h1>
<h2>Open Source Oracle Statistics
Gathering and Trending<br>
</h2>
<i>orca_oracle</i>
is a statistics gathering agent for Oracle
databases.&nbsp; In combination with <a
 href="http://www.orcaware.com/orca/">orca</a>,
it presents graphs
which provide intraday to multiyear views. <i>orca_oracle</i>
is
designed to assist working DBAs to gain a better understanding of the
performance of their systems.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">orca_oracle</span>
is designed to be
low impact and low maintenance. It uses the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">perfstat</span>
schema, collecting data
generated by your existing snapshot mechanism.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Through
orca's use of compact "round robin databases" the storage space
required for each monitored attribute does not change over time whilst
allowing up to three years history of daily averages. Database access
is reduced to a minimum and viewing of graphs generated from the
statistics gathered requires no more than a web browser.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">orca_oracle
</span>is built on an
Open Source basis and is available under the GPL, allowing improvements
to be carried out freely and taking advantage of the community approach
which open source encourages. It uses tools which have proved their
worth in production environments and which continue to improve through
the committed involvement of active user communities.<br>
<br>
Orca for Oracle presents data in graphs, which are collected and
displayed as web pages.&nbsp; Graphs and web pages can be updated
immediately new information is available, or batched for lower impact.<br>
<br>
As is usual with orca, graphs are normally created for these time
periods<br>
<ul>
  <li>Daily</li>
  <li>Weekly</li>
  <li>Monthly</li>
  <li>Quarterly</li>
  <li>Annual</li>
</ul>
<br>
It is possible to view a single performance statistic for all databases
monitored in a group, or to show the statistic at each time interval
simultaneously for one database.&nbsp; Navigation from one view of
the
data to another quickly becomes intuitive.<br>
<br>
As these graphs are images within a web page, it is a simple matter to
copy them for a service report, or to collect month-end statistics for
automated delivery.<br>
<h2>Example Output</h2>
Sample daily graphs are shown&nbsp; <a
 href="oracle_example-daily.html">here</a>.&nbsp;
For
a full installation, the links would connect to other sets of pages
though in this example only the links in the footer will&nbsp;
work.&nbsp; Note that precise, detailed information is included to
assist in interpreting the graph, including the time at which data was
lasted added and exact figures for this last element along with the
minimum, maximum and average of each value in the time period graphed.<br>
<br>
Fuller information on the meaning of the statistics presented is on <a

<span style="font-style: italic;">orca_oracle</span>
requires <br>
<dl>
  <dt>Statspack</dt>
  <dd>Check the plentiful official
documentation on installing statspack and
setting up regular data collection. Don't forget that you will need to
purge
older data eventually!
  </dd>
  <dt>Orca</dt>
  <dd><a href="http://www.orcaware.com/orca/">Orca</a>
performs all the graphing
and web page building functions. orca_oracle
is, really, just another collection agent for Orca.
  </dd>
  <dt>Perl DBI</dt>
  <dd>In addition to the perl
required to get Orca working, you'll need to
install the DBI and DBD::Oracle modules.</dd>
